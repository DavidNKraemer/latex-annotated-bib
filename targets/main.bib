@article{dufour2018expected,
 annotate = {Dufour and Genadot recall the definition of a strongly coercive function from
a paper of E. J. Blder ("Existence without explicit compactness in stochastic
dynamic programming"). I will translate this here so that I can compare it
directly with the definition of a $\KK$-inf-compact function. Recall that $u$
is $\KK$-inf-compact if 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $u$ is lower semi-continuous;
  \item whenever $\set{(x_n,y_n)}_{n=1}^{\infty} \in \Gr(\Phi)$ such that $x_n
    \to x$ and $\sup_{n \in \NN} u(x_n, y_n) < \infty$, then there exists
    a subsequence $(y_{n_k})_{k=1}^{\infty} \subseteq (y_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$
    such that $y_{n_k} \to y \in \Phi(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
According to Dufour and Genadot, $u$ is strongly coercive if whenever
$\set{(x_n, y_n)}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subseteq \Gr(\Phi)$ such that $x_n \to x$ and
$\liminf_{n \to \infty} u(x_n, y_n) = \ell < \infty$, there exists
a subsequence $(y_{n_k})_{k=1}^{\infty} \subseteq (y_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ such
that $y_{n_k} \to y \in \Phi(x)$ and $u(x_{n_k}, y_{n_k}) \leq \ell$.

We claim that these two definitions are equivalent.
